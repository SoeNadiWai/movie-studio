## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Configuration

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/MovieStudio.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/MovieStudio.git)
    ```
2.  **Open in Android Studio:** Open the cloned project in the latest stable version of Android Studio.
3.  **TMDB API Key:**
    * You will need a TMDB API key to run this application.
    * Visit [TMDB API](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api) to register and get your key.
    * Once you have your key, add it to the project. Typically, this is done by creating a `local.properties` file in the root of your project (if it doesn't exist) and adding the line:
        ```properties
        TMDB_API_KEY="YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY"
        ```
    * Then, update the `build.gradle` (app level) to read this key and make it available via `BuildConfig`:
        ```gradle
        // In android block -> defaultConfig
        buildConfigField("String", "TMDB_API_KEY", "\"${project.properties["TMDB_API_KEY"] ?: ""}\"")
        ```
    * Access it in your code (e.g., Repository or Network Module) using `BuildConfig.TMDB_API_KEY`.
4.  **Build and Run:** Build the project and run it on an Android emulator or physical device.
